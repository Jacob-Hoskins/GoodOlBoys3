              At Good Ol' Boys, we love seeing a room turn from a dull old faded
              color to a new vibrant area all thanks to a new coat of paint. Not
              sure what color to pick to help spice up your living space? Ask us
              about some popular choices! We choose top of the line paint to
              make sure you end up with the best possible finish available. One
              of the best parts of having a room painted is the way it'll boost
              your mood while youre at home. Plus it's a great way to help seal
              out moisture reducing the added weight that can put stress on your
              home's integrity.

              Have some leaky pipes? Want a new shower installed? Maybe even a
              new sink? We have the know how to get it done. We will make sure
              your plumbing is up to code and ready to be used the second we're
              done. We realize its important to have necessities like this
              working properly and done right the first time, and we would love
              to be the ones to update your bathroom dreams. We would hate to
              leave out the fact that new plumbing can also help lower your
              utility bills, and improve overall functionality.

              Have holes that need patched? We can do that. A room that a
              previous contractor started and then left halfway through leaving
              you looking at studs (And were not talking about the one in the
              mirror)? Did you have some water damage that left your walls
              needing fixed? We can solve all of the above problems and more!
              Finishing drywall is something we have worked long and hard at
              perfecting and we will make your wall look so nice youd think it's
              all one piece.

              We know the feeling of having old warn down carpet or hardwood
              floors, its annoying. We also know the feeling on installing new
              flooring and thats a feeling that we enjoy! If you're looking for
              something easier to clean or something more modern and updated we
              can make that happen at the Good Ol' Boys. Not to mention new
              flooring can help with insulation and allergies! And if you want
              better accoustics then Hardwood flooring is the way to go.
